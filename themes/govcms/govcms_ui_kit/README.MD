## About the theme

govCMS UI Kit uses:

 - [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for authoring stylesheets.
 - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for automatic CSS compatibility inclusions.
 - [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for pre-processing JavaScript / Sass / Images.
 - [UI-Kit](https://gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/) as a starter-kit.
 - [Owl Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) for an image slider.
 - [Object Fit Images](https://github.com/bfred-it/object-fit-images) for IE object-fit compatibility.
 - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (v.3.1.1 with [jQuery Migrate](https://plugins.jquery.com/migrate/) v.1.2.1) for general DOM manipulation.
 - [Customize Twitter](https://github.com/kevinburke/customize-twitter-1.1) for custom twitter styling.

This theme was built for [Department of Finance](http://www.finance.gov.au/) by [Salsa Digital](http://www.salsadigital.com.au/).

## Extending the theme

govCMS is best used as a base theme when theme changes are only minor. Substantial changes may be best made by duplicating the `../govcms_ui_kit` folder and changing the stylesheets / scripts as necessary.

## Modifying the theme

See `/grunt/README.MD` for information on the grunt setup and instructions for use.
